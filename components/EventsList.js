    bio:
      "Romit Roy Choudhury is a Professor and the Jerry Sanders Scholar of ECE and CS at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC). He joined UIUC from Fall 2013, prior to which he was at Duke University. He received the PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) in Fall 2006. His research interests are in wireless networking, embedded sensing, and applied signal processing. Along with his students, he received a few research awards, including the ACM Sigmobile Rockstar Award, the UIUC Distinguished Alumni Award, the 2017 MobiSys Best Paper Award, etc. Prof. Romit Roy Choudhury was elevated to IEEE Fellow in 2018.

    abstract:
      "This talk will make the case that “earables” could be the next milestone in mobile computing after smartphones. With numerous sensors, processors, and radios getting embedded into modern earphones, we envision a new eco-system around the ear. Earables will run voice assistants like Alexa; will sense human motion and gestures; will track health metrics through the ear; and will open new forms of AR/VR interactions through spatial 3D acoustics. The leap from today’s ear-phones to “earables” could mimic the transformation from basic-phones to smart phones. This talk will attempt to foresee the road ahead, with a focus on some of the research questions in the short and long term.",
